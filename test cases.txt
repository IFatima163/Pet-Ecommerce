As a user, i will use this e commerce platform to buy petcare items for my pets

As a new user, I want to be able to create an account so that I can track my orders and see history of previous orders.

As a customer, I want to be able to easily browse and search for products so that I can find what I am looking for.

Database:

products, receipt, customers, CustomerOrders, Seller

relation wrt sir's tutorial:
	prod = course
	receipt = teacher (prodID),
	customer = room, 
	Seller = Vehicle (prod id), 
	CustomerOrder = TeacherCourse (teacher id, course id) <customer id, order id>

database creation till 19:50
